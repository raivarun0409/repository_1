# Repository_1

A test repository to see how git works

Steps to be taken to check and upload any changes to the repository:

1. git status (to check the untracked change to the repo on the machine)
2. git add <filename.ext> (track the file, staging also a name to this step)
3. git commit -m "Inotial commit"
